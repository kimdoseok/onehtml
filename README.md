# onehtml
This merges a saved html file with image folder to embedded single html file   

## Purpose
When I want to keep informations from web, I usally save the page in my computer.  Few days ago, I found I lost image files of the saved html.  There are formats to do this.  Microsoft mht format is the best for this.  Unfortunately my firefox doesn't have ability to handle mht format.  It saves html and linked files to the file.  I decided to make a small python app for merging all files into one.  

## Tech
There is Tkinter for gui and it works without flaws.  On Mac brew distribution of python doesn't come with Tkinter.  You have to install Tkinter supported python.  Also there is binaries with pyinstaller for your convinient.  Also this mac dmg files is the first one in my life.  I've never worked on mac before.

## Usage
It is simple.  Run app and open saved file.  That's it.  All done.  As soon as you open file, it converts the file right away.  :)
All binaries are in binary folder if you don't want use python script.
